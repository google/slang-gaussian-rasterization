# Slang.D Gaussian Splatting Rasterizer

This repository contains a Slang.D implementation of the CUDA accelerated rasterizer that is described in the [3D Gaussian Splatting for Real-Time Rendering of Radiance Fields](https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/). We provide only the rasterizer and API bindings to the most popular implementations of the complete 3D Gaussian Splatting implementations:
1) The original inria [code-base](https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting) and 
2) [gsplat](https://github.com/nerfstudio-project/gsplat) from nerf-studio. 

*But why Slang.D?*

[Slang.D](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/differentiable-slang-a-shading-language-for-renderers-that-learn/) is a *unified platform for real-time, inverse and differentiable rendering*. Slang serves as an open-source language that allows developers to maintain a single code-base for differentiable high-performance rendering code-bases which can compile down to rendering code for different platforms like D3D, Vulkan, OpenGL, OptiX, CUDA etc.

This allows for a **single code-base** of the rendering code which has the capability to run at the same time under the differentiable framework of your choice (i.e Pytorch) and under the actual renderer that can be released for production (i.e Vulkan). This makes significant strides toward maintainability and reduces the likelihood of errors.

On top of that and potentially the most important for *research* is the ability of Slang.D to **differentiate automatically** through complicated rendering kernels that include *arbitrary control flow, user-defined types, dynamic dispatch, generics, and global memory accesses.*

## Installing

To install this library you need to install it as a pip package

```bash
git clone https://github.com/grgkopanas/slang-gaussian-rasterization.git
cd ./slang-gaussian-rasterization
pip install -e .
```

Now while you can use this pip package as any other python package, because we installed it in development mode any change you do either on the python side or on the Slang.D side will automatically reflect in your installed package without the need to pip install every time you make a change.

## Using it with popular 3DGS optimization libraries

While this library can act as a stand-alone rendering library for 3D-Gaussian Splatting. The most often use case of this library is use it during training of a 3DGS scene with either the original inria implementation or nerf-studio:

**Original Inria Implementation:** 

Pre-requisite: Download and install the [original inria repository](https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting/) by following the README file. Make sure that you can succesfully run the training script before you start the modifications.

To run the original inria training code with the slang back-end we need to patch [train.py](https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting/blob/main/train.py). The following commands asssume that your 3dgs-inria code-base is at [path-to-3dgs-inria]

```bash
cd [path-to-3dgs-inria]
wget https://github.com/grgkopanas/slang-gaussian-rasterization/raw/main/slang_gaussian_rasterization/api/patches/3dgs_inria.patch
git am 3dgs_inria.patch
```

Now you can run the train.py script as described in the inria 3DGS repo and the renderer you will be using is from the slang-gaussian-rasterization package. If you want to fall-back to the original cuda renderer you have to pass ```--render_backend inria_cuda``` to the train.py script.

**gsplat Implementation:** 
Similar to the original inria implementation we need to patch a few files from gsplat repo.

First we will clone the repo and patch it:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nerfstudio-project/gsplat.git
cd gsplat
git checkout fc1a3ca8b901279461a8dca2676eb9d600c18b7
wget https://github.com/grgkopanas/slang-gaussian-rasterization/raw/main/slang_gaussian_rasterization/api/patches/3dgs_gsplat.patch
git am 3dgs_gsplat.patch
pip install .
```
Now you can run the examples/simple_trainer.py script as described in the gsplat repo and by default the renderer it will use is from the slang-gaussian-rasterization package. If you want to fall-back to the original cuda renderer from gsplat you have to pass ```--render_backend gsplat_cuda``` to the examples/simple_trainer.py script.

## Perfomance and Evaluation
We run ```Bicycle-MipNeRF360``` as a representative scene to evaluate the perfomance and correctness of the released code.

| Code Variant  | Trainig Time | PSNR | 
| --------      | -------      | -----|
| 7k Inria - CUDA   | 3m 55s   | 23.40   |
| 7k Inria - Slang  | 4m 44s   | 23.41 |
| 30k Inria - CUDA  | 33m 10s  | 25.10 |
| 30k Inria - Slang | 36m 37s  | 25.12     |

Tested with an NVIDIA RTX 4090.


## Nice things to have
 - [x] Sort by value in one efficient call to the cu library instead of sorting the keys and indexing the value tensor.
 - [ ] Investigate what makes the forward/backward pass X% slower.
 - [ ] Support more gsplat rendering features.
